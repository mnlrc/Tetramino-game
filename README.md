# Tetramino-game
My second projet in computer science. The program lets you play a simple puzzle game called 'tetramino' in french.

This project mostly works but there are two issues. 

-> First one is that the isn't any solution to the second set of 'tetraminos'

-> A 'tetramino' can glitch out of the grid with a rotation. The program doesn't crash (as far as I know) but it's very confusing.

I added a test file, given to us while doing the project. The getkey file was also given.
